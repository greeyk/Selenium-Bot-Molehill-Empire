# A web game Molehill Empire(Zielone Imperium) automated with Selenium

Simple bot that helps the player to plant, water, harvest and sell plants. It has a UI in which you choose the plants to be planted. Automatically relogs when the player is logged out.

If chromedriver is outdated you should download a driver compatible with your browser version from :
* https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and place it in the "SeleniumDrivers" folder.

Before launching the apliaction, you may first need to manually log into your account and close the newly added event pop-ups in the game. After that, the app should be usable and automate tasks.
